# Payment Gateway Requirements

## Feature Overview
The payment gateway feature will enable the memory assistant application to process payments through multiple payment methods including credit cards and PayPal. It will support one-time payments as well as subscription management, and provide webhook handling for real-time payment event notifications. This feature is essential for monetizing premium features of the memory assistant application.

## User Stories

### User Story 1: Credit Card Processing

- **Scope:** So that users can access premium features immediately after successful payment

### User Story 2: PayPal Integration
**As a** premium user,
**I want** to pay with my PayPal account,
**so that** I can use my preferred payment method.

**EARS Format:**
- **Event:** When a user selects PayPal as payment method
- **Artifact:** The payment system
- **Result:** Shall redirect to PayPal for authentication and payment processing
- **Scope:** So that users can complete transactions using their PayPal balance or linked payment methods

### User Story 3: Subscription Management
**As a** premium user,
**I want** to manage my subscription plan,
**so that** I can upgrade, downgrade, or cancel my subscription as needed.

**EARS Format:**
- **Event:** When a user accesses their subscription settings
- **Artifact:** The subscription management system
- **Result:** Shall display current subscription status and allow modifications
- **Scope:** So that users have full control over their subscription preferences

### User Story 4: Webhook Handling
**As a** system administrator,
**I want** to receive real-time notifications for payment events,
**so that** I can maintain accurate payment records and respond to issues promptly.

**EARS Format:**
- **Event:** When a payment event occurs (success, failure, refund, etc.)
- **Artifact:** The webhook handling system
- **Result:** Shall receive and process the event notification
- **Scope:** So that the system can update user accounts and trigger appropriate actions

## Functional Requirements

### FR-1: Credit Card Processing
The system must securely process credit card payments through a payment gateway provider, supporting major credit card brands (Visa, MasterCard, American Express, Discover). The system must validate card information, process payments, and handle success and failure scenarios appropriately.

### FR-2: PayPal Integration
The system must integrate with PayPal's API to enable payments through PayPal accounts. This includes redirecting users to PayPal for authentication and payment, handling the return flow, and processing payment confirmations.

### FR-3: Subscription Management
The system must support creating, updating, and canceling subscriptions. This includes handling different subscription tiers, prorating charges for upgrades/downgrades, and managing subscription lifecycle events (renewals, expirations, etc.).

### FR-4: Webhook Handling
The system must implement webhook endpoints to receive and process payment event notifications from payment providers. This includes validating webhook signatures, parsing event data, and triggering appropriate system actions based on event types.

### FR-5: Payment History
The system must maintain a complete payment history for each user, including transaction details, amounts, dates, and status. Users must be able to view their payment history through the application interface.

### FR-6: Refund Processing
The system must support processing refunds for payments and subscriptions, including partial and full refunds, with appropriate logging and notification.

## Non-Functional Requirements

### NFR-1: Security
All payment processing must comply with PCI DSS requirements. Sensitive payment information must never be stored in the application database. All communications with payment providers must be encrypted using industry-standard protocols.

### NFR-2: Reliability
The payment system must be highly reliable with minimal downtime. Payment processing must succeed or fail with clear error messages. The system must handle temporary failures gracefully with appropriate retry mechanisms.

### NFR-3: Performance
Payment processing must complete within acceptable time limits (typically under 30 seconds for most operations). Webhook processing must be efficient to handle high volumes of events without delays.

### NFR-4: Scalability
The payment system must be able to handle increasing transaction volumes as the user base grows, without degradation in performance or reliability.

### NFR-5: Auditability
All payment operations must be logged with sufficient detail to support auditing, troubleshooting, and reconciliation. Logs must include timestamps, user identifiers, transaction details, and system responses.

## Acceptance Criteria

### AC-1: Credit Card Processing
- Users can enter credit card information through a secure form

- PayPal payment confirmations are properly processed
- Transaction details are recorded in the payment history

### AC-3: Subscription Management
- Users can view their current subscription status and details
- Users can upgrade their subscription tier with prorated charges
- Users can downgrade their subscription tier with appropriate adjustments
- Users can cancel their subscription with immediate or end-of-period effect
- Subscription changes are properly reflected in billing and access rights

### AC-4: Webhook Handling
- Webhook endpoints properly receive and validate event notifications
- Payment success events trigger appropriate account updates
- Payment failure events trigger appropriate notifications and account handling
- Webhook processing includes proper error handling and retry logic
- Webhook events are logged for auditing and troubleshooting

## Dependencies

### DEP-1: Payment Gateway Provider
Integration with a third-party payment gateway provider (such as Stripe, Braintree, or similar) that supports credit card processing and PayPal integration.

### DEP-2: User Authentication System
Integration with the existing user authentication system to associate payments with user accounts.

### DEP-3: Database Schema
Extension of the existing database schema to store payment and subscription information.

### DEP-4: Notification System
Integration with the existing notification system to alert users of payment events and subscription changes.

## Assumptions

### ASS-1: Payment Provider APIs
We assume that the selected payment provider offers comprehensive APIs for payment processing, subscription management, and webhook notifications.

### ASS-2: User Base
We assume that users have access to either credit cards or PayPal accounts for making payments.

### ASS-3: Regulatory Compliance
We assume that the application will operate in jurisdictions where the selected payment methods are legally compliant.

### ASS-4: Technical Infrastructure
We assume that the existing technical infrastructure can support the additional load and requirements of payment processing.

## Constraints

### CON-1: PCI Compliance
The system must be designed to minimize PCI DSS scope by avoiding storage of sensitive payment information.

### CON-2: Third-Party Dependencies
The system will be dependent on third-party payment providers, which may introduce limitations on customization and potential service disruptions.

### CON-3: Currency Support
Initial implementation will support a limited set of currencies (USD, EUR, GBP) based on payment provider capabilities.

### CON-4: Time and Resources
Development will be constrained by available time and resources, requiring prioritization of features and phased implementation.

## Out of Scope

### OOS-1: Alternative Payment Methods
Integration with alternative payment methods such as cryptocurrency, bank transfers, or regional payment systems is not included in the initial scope.

### OOS-2: Advanced Fraud Detection
While basic fraud prevention measures will be implemented, advanced fraud detection systems using machine learning or AI are not included in the initial scope.

### OOS-3: Multi-Currency Accounting
Complex multi-currency accounting features such as automatic currency conversion at optimal rates are not included in the initial scope.

### OOS-4: Payment Analytics
Advanced payment analytics and reporting beyond basic transaction history are not included in the initial scope.
